Intrusion Detection (Mini Project)



A simple machine learning project for intrusion detection using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.



Dataset



\- UNSW-NB15

\- Training and testing sets are used for evaluation.



Models



\- Decision Tree

\- Random Forest

\- Random Forest with Pipeline + GridSearchCV



Workflow



\- Load training and testing data

\- Preprocess features (one-hot encoding for categorical variables)

\- Train baseline models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)

\- Build pipeline and tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV

\- Evaluate models on the test set
